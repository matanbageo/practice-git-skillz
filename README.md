# Demo Homework Repo

This repository is a demo repository that you can use to practice your GitHub and git skills while working
throughout he online lessons in the [introduction to earth data science textbook on earthdatascience.org](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/version-control/). We will not merge any pull requests here but you can practice opening and closing them here if you want!

It’s time to practice your git skills! Do the following:

If you haven’t already, fork the https://github.com/earthlab-education/practice-git-skillz repo.
Next, clone your fork of that repo using git clone
Open up the README.md file and make some changes to the text
Use git add and git commit to add and commit those changes
Finally push the changes up to github.com using git push
Now, go to the url where the repo is on Github.com - the path to the repo likely looks something like the path below:

(replace your-github-username with your real github username!)

https://github.com/your-github-username/practice-git-skillz

Do you see your changes to the README.md file?
